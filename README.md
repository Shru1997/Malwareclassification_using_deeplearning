# Malwareclassification_using_deeplearning

Topic:Malware classification using  deeplearning.

Resources:
1.Anaconda Navigator >> Jupyter Lab>>console powershell prompt.

3.Database: SQLite3

Dataset:
As it is a malware classification, we cannot download the dataset which may effect our system. So i have choosen the dataset which was present in the dropbox.The datset used is Malimg dataset. 9339 samples of malware are represented greyscale images. Every samples of malware in the dataset corresponds to one of 25 families/classes of malware.

There are 8394 training malware samples and 945 testing samples.

Please download the dataset and the model weights file from the link below:
